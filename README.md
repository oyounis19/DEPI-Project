# Medical AI Assistant

This project is a **Medical AI Assistant** that leverages advanced language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer medical-related queries. The assistant uses **Phi-3.5**, a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on **PubMed-QA** using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for medical QA tasks, combined with a RAG system created by **LangChain** that retrieves information from multiple medical books. The project is accessible through a GUI built with **Streamlit**.

## Features

- **LLM**: `phi-3.5`, fine-tuned on PubMed-QA for answering medical queries.
- **RAG System**: Retrieval-augmented generation using LangChain, retrieving answers from a collection of books related to the medical field.
- **Streamlit GUI**: User-friendly web application interface for easy interaction with the AI assistant.

## Project Structure

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ phi-3.5-qa-finetuning.ipynb        # Fine-tuning phi-3.5 on PubMed-QA using LoRA
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment.ipynb                   # Code and instructions for deploying the assistant
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ books_retrieval.ipynb              # Downloads books for the RAG system
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RAG.ipynb                          # RAG system creation using LangChain
â”œâ”€â”€ vectorstore/                           # Contains the vector index for document retrieval
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                                 # Streamlit app for the GUI
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py                               # Helper functions (loading LLM, chain setup, etc.)
```

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can interact with the AI assistant through the Streamlit interface. Simply type your medical-related questions, and the assistant will retrieve information from the medical books using the RAG system and answer using the fine-tuned `phi-3.5` model.
